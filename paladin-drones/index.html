          <h1> Mission </h1>
          <p>A fire doubles in size every 30 seconds.</p>
          <p>When dealing with emergencies, <em>every single second could mean the difference between life and death</em>. But so many public agencies simply don't know enough when at the scene. The location could be inaccurate, or there could be a traffic jam, and the only way to find out is after reaching there. This wastes time, and in an era where information is availible a fingertouch away, it's unacceptable for everyday heroes to not have the same access.</p>
          <p>At Paladin, we want to <em>minimize any guesswork involved</em>, and provide as much information to the people who need it most. Our UAV platform is an autonomous tool, designed to give responders the situational awareness they need, without sacrificing someone to control the drone. A department using our platform can <em>save at least 2 minutes in response time</em>, and decrease operational costs by at least $100,000.</p>
